To read fluently, students must master fundamental skills of decoding and automaticity. This test measures a student's ability to detect real and made-up words, which can then translate to a student's reading levels and need for support. The student's score will rangekkk between 100-900 and can be viewed by selecting 'Raw Score' on the table above."

This assessment is helpful for identifying students who may struggle with reading comprehension due to difficulties with decoding words accurately or reading slowly and with effort.

Knowing letter names supports the learning of letter sounds, and knowing letter sounds supports the learning of letter names. Initial knowledge of letter names and letter sounds on entry to kindergarten has been shown to predict success in learning to read. Learning the connection between letters and the sounds they represent is fundamental for learning to decode and spell words. This assessment provides educators with valuable insights to customize instruction and address any gaps in these foundational skills."
